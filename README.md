# FFNx

Next generation modding platform for Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy VIII ( with native Steam 2013 release support! )

## Introduction

FFNx is an attempt to move forward what you were used to know as [FF7_OpenGL](https://github.com/Aali132/ff7_opengl) driver, [made by Aali](http://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=14922.0).

FFNx today in a nutshell:

- An easy drag-n-drop installation experience, see [How to Install](docs/how_to_install.md)
- It comes by default if you use 7th 2.3 or higher version
- It supports the newest video and audio codecs ( WEBM, H.265, Ogg, etc.)
- It enhances the gameplay experience drastically compared to the vanilla experience
- It supports 4 stable (+ 1 experimental) rendering Backends:
  - OpenGL
  - DirectX 9 ( Experimental: Not Recommended )
  - DirectX 11 ( default )
  - DirectX 12
  - Vulkan

## How to build

Available build profiles:

- x86-Release ( default, the same used to release artifacts in this Github page )
- x86-RelWithDebInfo ( used while developing to better debug some issues )
- x86-MinSizeRel
- x86-Debug ( prefer it if you want to use a debugger attached to the game )

Once the project is build you can find the output in this path: `.build/bin`

### Preparation

> **Please note:**
>
> FFNx will now use vcpkg as a package manager to resolve dependencies. Failing to follow these steps will fail your builds.

0. Clone the [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) project in the root folder of your `C:` drive ( `git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git` )
1. Go inside the `C:\vcpkg` folder and double click `bootstrap-vcpkg.bat`
2. Open a `cmd` window in `C:\vcpkg` and run the following command: `vcpkg integrate install`

### Visual Studio

> **Please note:**
>
> By default Visual Studio will pick the **x86-Release** build configuration, but you can choose any other profile available.

0. Download the the latest [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) installer
1. Run the installer and import this [.vsconfig](.vsconfig) file in the installer to pick the required components to build this project
2. Make sure you select the English Language pack in the language list before clicking Install
3. Once installed, open this repository **as a folder** in Visual Studio 2022 and click the build button

### Visual Studio Code

0. **REQUIRED!** Follow up the steps to install Visual Studio, which will also install the MSVC toolchain
1. Download and install the latest [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) release
2. Install the following extensions:
   - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools
   - https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools
3. Open this repository as a folder in Visual Studio code
4. Choose as build profile in the status bar `CMake: [Release]` ( or one of the aforementioned profiles )
5. Click the button on the status bar `Build`

## Auto-Formatting

### CMake Files

0. **REQUIRED!** Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
1. Install [cmake-format](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format#installation) and make sure the binary is available in your PATH environment variable
2. **OPTIONAL!** Integrate it [in your own IDE](https://github.com/cheshirekow/cmake_format#integrations) ( eg. for Visual Studio Code use [the relative extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cheshirekow.cmake-format) )
