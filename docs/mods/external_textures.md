# External textures

You can override game's textures with images in DDS (recommended) or PNG format.
To know where to put your custom textures, set the option `trace_loaders` to `true` and look at the content of FFNx.log
when the game is running.

It is also possible to dump textures on runtime in PNG format by setting the option `save_textures` to true.

By default, FFNx looks for textures relatively to the `./mods/Textures` directory, this path can be changed via the option `mod_path`.
